### iNaturalist Species Classification 
The iNat datasets contain images of visually similar species, captured in a wide variety of situations, from all over the world. Images were collected with different camera types, have varying image quality, feature a large class imbalance, and have been verified by multiple citizen scientists from the online platform iNaturalist. There are currently four different variants of the iNat dataset: iNat2017, iNat2018, iNat2019, and iNat2021.

### iWildCam
The iWildCam datasets contain diverse sets of camera trap imagery with a focus on tackling challenges in applying computer vision to ecological monitoring with static sensors, such as generalizing models to new sensor deployments or novel species or incorporating data from alternate image capture domains such as community science or satellite imagery. There are currently four different variants of the iWildCam dataset: iWildCam 2018, iWildCam 2019, iWildCam 2020, and iWildCam 2021.

### Fashionpedia
Dataset for instance segmentation and attribute localization. Fashionpedia consists of: (1) an anthology built by fashion experts containing 27 main apparel categories, 19 apparel parts, 294 fine-grained attributes, and their relationships. (2) a dataset with everyday and celebrity event fashion images annotated with segmentation masks and their associated per-mask fine-grained attributes, built upon the Fashionpedia ontology.
